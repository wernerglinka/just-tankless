I called another company and they checked the error codes but couldn't fix the problem..and then yesterday, it just stopped turning on.</p><p>Al was responsive and frank on the phone that he couldn't help me with an intermittent issue given there is no consistent repro. After I called him a second time when hester stopped working, he stopped by and diagnosed the flow sensor to be the issue in no time. He cleaned and everything was working again.</p><p>He also commented on my pump and polyphosphate filter setup and gave tips on how I could flush the heater myself.  You can tell he has a in-depth technical knowledge of this.</p><p>I would highly recommend his services. Thanks.</p>",

    "review": "<p>Al fixed my tankless problem within 10 minutes. My 9 year old tankless quit working this morning, no hot water. I contacted the installer but they couldn't come out until Monday. I discovered Just Tankless on Yelp and spoke with Al. He asked a few questions, and although he was busy he said he'd be here in 30 minutes. Amazing! Problem solved! Just Tankless will be my first call from now on!</p>",
