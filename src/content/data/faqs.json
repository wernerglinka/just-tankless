  {
    "question": "Will there be any difference in usage?",
    "answer": "<p>No, in some cases, you may get hot water sooner to your shower head or faucet than before because of the new location of the water heater being closer to the point of use. A smart-reticulating system design can give instant hot water at any faucet or shower head. We’ll be glad to share more information with you.</p>"

    "question": "Where is the Tankless Water Heater installed?",
    "answer": "<p>The location of installation is significant for trouble-free operation. All crucial factors are adequate venting, oxygen, plumbing, and sufficient gas supply. Our experienced personnel will gladly discuss all available options with you.</p>"

  {
    "question": "Are there any special requirements for tankless water heater installation?",
    "answer": "<p>Yes, since water is heated instantly, more heating energy is needed, which requires a slightly larger gas line to provide the additional gas volume needed. This is updated as part of the installation.</p><p>Tankless water heaters don’t have an always-burning pilot-like tank type; they are pilotless but need electricity to ignite the gas initially. The electricity usage is very minimal. A new electrical connection will be provided as part of the installation.</p><p>As water is heated instantly, more heat is produced that sometimes requires special venting; this installation depends</p>"

    "question": "Can I install a tankless water heater myself?",
    "answer": "<p>Expert installation is critical to safety, trouble-free operation, and manufacturer’s warranty. As with any potentially dangerous situation, it is best to use a licensed and factory-trained plumber, gas fitter, and electrician. Besides voiding the manufacturer’s warranty use of unqualified persons can be dangerous when handling gas, water, and electricity.</p>"

    "question": "Fluctuating Water Temperatue at the Shower?",
    "answer": "<p>When experiencing fluctuating water temperature in your shower, it is often not the fault of the tankless heater but rather the shower fixture. Many of the German brands Grohe and Hansgrohe fixtures cause the problem. They have a built-in thermostatic valve that tries to control the water temperature at the institution and limit the max temperature. It then oscillates between lukewarm and hot as its thermostatic valve opens and closes. There is an internal adjustment to raise the temperature setting, but these fixtures are over-engineered and trouble some besides being expensive.</p><p>They may work well in Germany as many towns have central water heating. Yes, central water heating! You get hot water delivered just like cold water; the hot water is often boiling. There are two water meters, one for hot and one for cold. The hot water is generated by garbage incinerators, cooling water from nuclear power plants, etc., and pumped throughout the town. Each home or building has a heat exchanger to extract the heat.</p>"

    "question": "Why not buy a Tankless Water Heater from Amazon, Ebay, Home Depot or other Warehouses?",
    "answer": "<p>We recommend local plumbing companies who are experienced and are at hand when you need service. Having to wait on service for hot water can be very frustrating. Using local plumbers also helps your community by supporting local businesses.</p><p>Amazon and others have started selling services online for referral; they demand about 20% of the total cost. That is steep and something the local plumber has to make up for it in other ways with the customer, and not always in a transparent manner.</p><p>If something goes wrong, the customer is caught between the seller (i.e., Amazon) and the installer (plumber), each pointing to the other for being responsible.</p><p>Similarly, this is the case buying from Home Depot, Lowe's, or other large stores. They subcontract the installation through a referral with steep referral fees from the installation company.</p><p>Some retailers even use out-of-state companies to install, and when the time comes for service, they need to be more responsive.</p><p>Our price checks have shown no price advantage compared to the local company selling and installing the tankless unit. Oversized boxes and online referred installation companies tend to be more expensive because the installation company has to make up for the hefty referral fees.</p><p>Additionally, Tankless Water Heater Manufactures require an installation by a certified installation company for the tankless water heater to be warranted.</p>"

    "question": "What is hot water recirculation?",
    "answer": "<p>Hot water recirculation is a system that helps to deliver hot water to the faucets and fixtures in a building more quickly and efficiently. It works by circulating hot water from the water heater back through the pipes and into the fixtures, rather than letting the water cool off in the pipes before it is used. This can save energy and reduce water waste, as it reduces the need to run the tap for a long time to get hot water.</p><p>There are several types of hot water recirculation systems, including:</p><ul><li>Dedicated return line systems: These systems have a separate pipe that carries the cooled-off water back to the water heater to be reheated.</li><li>Pump-assisted systems: These systems use a pump to circulate the hot water through the pipes.</li><li>Demand-controlled systems: These systems use sensors to determine when hot water is needed and only circulate the water when it is needed.</li></ul><p>Hot water recirculation systems can be installed in both residential and commercial buildings. They are typically more efficient and convenient than traditional hot water delivery systems and can help to save energy and water.</p><p>Here are a couple of links to videos about hot water recirculation systems:</p><ul><li><a href='https://www.navieninc.com/media/videos#videos-13' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>https://www.navieninc.com/media/videos#videos-13</a></li><li><a href='https://www.navieninc.com/media/videos#videos-1' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>https://www.navieninc.com/media/videos#videos-1</a></li></ul>"
