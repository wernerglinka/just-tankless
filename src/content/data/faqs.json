    "question": "Fluctuating Water Temperatue at the Shower?",
    "answer": "When experiencing fluctuating water temperature in your shower, it is often not the fault of the tankless heater but rather the shower fixture. Many of the German brands Grohe and Hansgrohe fixtures cause the problem. They have a built-in thermostatic valve that tries to control the water temperature at the institution and limit the max temperature. It then oscillates between lukewarm and hot as its thermostatic valve opens and closes. There is an internal adjustment to raise the temperature setting, but these fixtures are over-engineered and trouble some besides being expensive. \n They may work well in Germany as many towns have central water heating. Yes, central water heating! You get hot water delivered just like cold water; the hot water is often boiling. There are two water meters, one for hot and one for cold. The hot water is generated by garbage incinerators, cooling water from nuclear power plants, etc., and pumped throughout the town. Each home or building has a heat exchanger to extract the heat."

    "question": "Why not buy a Tankless Water Heater from Amazon, Ebay, Home Depot or other Warehouses?",
    "answer": "We recommend local plumbing companies who are experienced and are at hand when you need service. Having to wait on service for hot water can be very frustrating. Using local plumbers also helps your community by supporting local businesses. \n Amazon and others have started selling services online for referral; they demand about 20% of the total cost. That is steep and something the local plumber has to make up for it in other ways with the customer, and not always in a transparent manner. \n If something goes wrong, the customer is caught between the seller (i.e., Amazon) and the installer (plumber), each pointing to the other for being responsible. \n Similarly, this is the case buying from Home Depot, Lowe's, or other large stores. They subcontract the installation through a referral with steep referral fees from the installation company. \n Some retailers even use out-of-state companies to install, and when the time comes for service, they need to be more responsive. \n Our price checks have shown no price advantage compared to the local company selling and installing the tankless unit. Oversized boxes and online referred installation companies tend to be more expensive because the installation company has to make up for the hefty referral fees. \n Additionally, Tankless Water Heater Manufactures require an installation by a certified installation company for the tankless water heater to be warranted."
