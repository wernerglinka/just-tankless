      header: "h3"

      prose: |-
        A Tankless Water Heater saves energy by not having a storage tank full of heated water 24/7. Water is heated only on demand and at a much higher efficiency.

      title: Tankless Water Heater Benefits
      header: "h2"
      subTitle: ""

      prose: |-

        - **Energy efficiency**: Tankless water heaters are generally more energy efficient than storage tank water heaters because they only heat water as needed, rather than constantly heating and reheating a large tank of water. This can result in significant energy savings over time.
        - **Compact size**: Tankless water heaters are generally more compact than storage tank water heaters, which can be an advantage in homes with limited space.
        - **Unlimited hot water**: Tankless water heaters are capable of providing an unlimited supply of hot water on demand, as long as the unit is properly sized for the hot water needs of the household. This can be a significant advantage in homes with high hot water demand or multiple hot water taps in use simultaneously.
        - **Longer lifespan**: Tankless water heaters typically have a longer lifespan than storage tank water heaters, as they do not suffer from the same wear and tear from constantly heating and reheating water in the tank.
