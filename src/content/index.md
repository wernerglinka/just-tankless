        A Tankless Water Heater saves energy by not having a storage tank full of heated water 24/7. Water is heated only on demand and at a much higher efficiency.

        ## What is a Tankless Water Heater?
    
        As the name suggests, a tankless water heater does not have a storage tank like a traditional water heater. Instead, it heats water on demand as it flows through the unit. This means that it only heats the water you need when needed, resulting in significant energy savings compared to a traditional tank model.

        ## Advantages of a Tankless Water Heater
        
        There are several advantages to choosing a tankless water heater over a traditional tank model:

        - **Energy Efficiency**: Tankless water heaters are highly efficient because they only heat the water you need. This means that they use less energy overall, resulting in lower utility bills.
        - **Space Savings**: Tankless water heaters are much smaller than traditional tank models, so they take up less space in your home.
        - **Longer Lifespan**: Tankless water heaters typically last longer than traditional tank models, with a lifespan of up to 20 years or more.
        - **Consistent Hot Water**: With a tankless water heater, you'll never run out of hot water. The unit heats water on demand, so you'll always have a steady supply of hot water whenever you need it.
        - **Cleaner Water**: Tankless water heaters don't store water in a tank, which means there's less chance of bacteria or other contaminants building up in the unit.

        **If you're interested in installing a tankless water heater, it's important to have a professional handle the installation process. At Just Tankless, our team of experts can help you choose the right unit for your home and ensure it's installed correctly.**
